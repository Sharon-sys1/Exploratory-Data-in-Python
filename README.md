# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## Project Overview

This project showcases a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes data inspection, cleaning, and transformation, followed by the identification of patterns, correlations, and key insights.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas for data manipulation

- NumPy for numerical operations

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Key EDA Steps

- Viewing dataset structure and summary statistics

- Handling missing values and data types

- Creating visualizations to explore trends and distributions

- Using groupby and aggregation to compare metrics across categories

- Detecting correlations with heatmaps and scatter plots
